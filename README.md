# ChessBot

This is a basic chess program with an AI opponent which I wrote in Java as a school project when I was 16 years old.

## How it works

The AI is capable of rating a given state of the game for each team.
It brute-forces through all possible states, several moves ahead, and assumes each team tries to reach the highest score.
Whichever move results in the highest predicted score for the AIs team is performed.

## Controls

Clicking on a piece selects it an highlights all possible moves, which can be performed with another click.
The AI opponent performs its move directly afterwards.
